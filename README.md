# Emotion Recognition from Face Data

**Problem Statement:** We use multiple methods we learned in class to do emotion recognition using pictures of faces. Methods we plan to try are eigenvalue decomposition and PCA, with more advanced methods to follow if there is time (Robust PCA, etc). In addition to the methods learned in class for learning different representations, we will use logistic regression and for classification.

Data Source: We plan to use this [face dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data) which consists of 48x48 grayscale images of faces with labels in one of 7 categories: 0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral.
